Course project for CFG course - Web Development 2024

Website about the Netherlands was developed by Group 2

Website link: https://umka-dev.github.io/

Review project idea:

The main page is dedicated to the country itself.  It has some basic information about the Netherlands and links, that lead to 4 additional pages with information about 4 biggest Dutch cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht.

Each group member has their own code section on the main page and also can choose the city, they would like to make a page about. Thus our project involves both teamwork on the main page and individual work on the “own” city page. Also, it’s flexible - in case of a change in the number of project participants, it can be easily adjusted by deleting or adding pages.

Project objectives:
1) create website wireframes
2) create a responsive website with working links using HTML, CSS, and JS
3) learn to work in a team of web developers
