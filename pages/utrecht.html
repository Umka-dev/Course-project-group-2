            <h1>Welcome to Utrecht</h1>
            <p>
                Utrecht is a very lively and hospitable place.
                Built around the centuries-old Dom Tower,
                the city center is branched by many picturesque canals,
                some with extraordinary wharf cellars that house shops,
                caf√©s, restaurants, and bars along the water.
                Add to that the charm of the many merchants' houses,
                courts scattered throughout the city,
                and the ancient next to modern architecture,
                and you start to have an idea of what brings
                so much charm to this city.

                <h2>The fourth largest city in the Netherlands</h2>
                <p>Utrecht is a city that is both small and lively,
                    ancient and innovative,
                    always maintaining its historical centre
                    and at the same time constantly updating itself.
                    It's the fourth largest city in the Netherlands,
                    is an amazing city and here are reasons why:</p>

                <h3>5 Reasons Why Utrecht is Awesome</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>Utrecht's compact size</summary>
                    <p>The city is relatively small in size,
                        despite its population of around 345.000.
                        You can navigate the whole city easily on foot.
                        There's an extensive pedestrian-only zone making up
                        most of the city centre, which makes it even easier to stroll around.
                        Even though Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands,
                        it is compact in size and therefore very easy to get
                        a broad sense of the city in a short space of time.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Unique Utrecht canals</summary>
                    <p>Utrecht's inner-city canals have a unique appearance
                        because they have wharves.
                        If you're at the Oudegracht (Old Canal),
                        you'll notice a lower level to the canal where you can find bars
                        and restaurants a few metres below the street, almost at water level.
                        This was where merchant ships used to drop off goods back in the 13th century,
                        and these goods were stored in the warehouses along the wharf.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>The largest university in the Netherlands</summary>
                    <p>With around 30.000 studying at Utrecht University,
                        it's larger than any other university in the country.
                        Many people are unaware of this fact,
                        although it's not difficult to notice that the student population
                        is disproportionately large compared to the neat size of the city.
                        Utrecht University is also one of the oldest in the Netherlands,
                        established in 1636, and is renowned for major breakthroughs
                        in science over the centuries.</p>

                    <summary>The hub of the Dutch rail network</summary>
                    <p>Utrecht has the busiest train station in the Netherlands,
                        being at the centre of the country,
                        with an average of about 900 train journeys departing from Utrecht
                        on a working day and many more passing by.
                        If you live near the hub of such a rail network,
                        you can really benefit from it.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>A historic city centre </summary>
                    <p>Utrecht is a historic city with intact Medieval buildings.
                        It has been an important centre of Christianity since the 8th century
                        and was actually the most important city for hundreds of years.
                        During the Dutch Golden Age, this honour was passed onto Amsterdam
                        and the capital city's prominence has remained ever since.
                    </p>
                    <p>On a day visiting the sites of Utrecht, there are more Medieval churches
                        than you could possibly count. The famous Dom tower is the focal point of Utrecht,
                        right in the heart of the city centre. It was once connected to the cathedral of Saint Martin,
                        but that portion of the building was damaged and never rebuilt - which is why, nowadays,
                        the tower stands all by itself,
                        overlooking the city and its surrounding areas.</p>

                    <p>In the last century, the castle also frequently hosted members

                        from Coco Chanel to Roger Moore,
